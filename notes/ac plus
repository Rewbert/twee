- order axioms by complexity (in frontend?)
- label each rule with which axioms it comes from
- can also compute for each critical pair
- now find "max axiom" for each queued cp and compute min
- no queued cp has max axiom less than this => axioms [1..min-1] are complete
- take rules having max axiom <= min-1
