Work out why LAT044-1.p and BOO067-1.p have regressed.
BOO067-1 works with --no-simplify --no-ground-joining. Why?

It may be that:
  t = u is ground joinable
but we want to apply t_sigma = u_sigma in ground joining a later rule
and then we can't because it's not a case split on variables.
That suggests that we should case split on not-variables by replacing
them with uninterpreted variables temporarily.
