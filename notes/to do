add extra rules:
if a rule is simplified away, keep it as an extra rule, in case of
case-split-on-not-vars note below (?)
maybe do that only if a rule is ground joined?

simplification: add complete version
plan: define total order on rules which is compatible with KBO
(i.e., order on orientable rules is defined by KBO); only rewrite wrt
lesser rules. Note: compatibility implies that we don't have to check
this condition when applying oriented rules, only unoriented.

re-add cancellative laws?

goal-directed: combine two rules with forward reasoning
(makes it easier to e.g. identify useful critical pairs)

CP compression for longer runs.

Look into twee with boolean preconditions. (Also twee with theories.)

Work out why LAT044-1.p and BOO067-1.p have regressed.
BOO067-1 works with --no-simplify --no-ground-joining. Why?

It may be that:
  t = u is ground joinable
but we want to apply t_sigma = u_sigma in ground joining a later rule
and then we can't because it's not a case split on variables.
That suggests that we should case split on not-variables by replacing
them with uninterpreted variables temporarily.
