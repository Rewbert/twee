This is twee, a prover for equational problems.

To install, run cabal install.

Afterwards, invoke as twee nameofproblem.p. The problem should be in
TPTP format (http://www.tptp.org). You can find a few examples in the
tests directory. All axioms and conjectures must be equations, but you
can freely use types and quantifiers.

Twee is experimental software, use at your own risk!
